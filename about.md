A little background ...

I'm a freelance Cloud Architect focused on Microsoft Azure training and consulting.  I've been working with Azure since February 2010 when it was first released.  I have experience working with organizations of all sizes, helping them architect, design, implement, and deploy Azure solutions.  Much of my work has focused on Azure governance and foundational best practices including identity, security, hybrid networking, management, monitoring, and DevOps.

I'm also a Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) with experience delivering Azure courses covering fundamentals, architecture, design, and administration-related topics.

Please feel free to contact me if I can assist with any Azure-related work.

### More Information

I graduated from the University of Illinois with a BS in Computer Science.  I live in Naperville, IL with my wife.  And when I find the time, I enjoy brewing beer and making cider.
