Thanks for spending a minute on my blog!  Here's a little background info...

I'm a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft where I've been working with Azure for the past 5+ years.  I work with organizations of all sizes helping them to adopt Azure and related cloud technologies.  My background is in software engineering but I've spent more time than I care to admit digging into virtualization, networking and storage technologies since they're such a fundamental part of most organization's shift to public cloud.  I'm bullish on PaaS and feel strongly that it can help organizations focus more time on designing great software and less on managing the underlying infrastructure.

### More Information

I graduated from the University of Illinois with a BS in Computer Science.  I live in Naperville, IL with my wife and two children.  And when I find the time, I enjoy brewing a good batch of beer.
