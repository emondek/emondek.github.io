title: Azure Usage Analytics Report - February 2017 Update
---

I made two updates to the February 2017 edition of the report:

1. Pull 2017 data from the Billing API
2. Only pull the past 6 months of data since too many records are causing timeout errors.  You can change this in PowerQuery if you choose.

You can download the latest report here - [Azure Usage Analytics Report Feb 2017 Update](/files/Azure%20Usage%20Analytics%20(API)%20Feb%202017.xlsx).

Cheers!
