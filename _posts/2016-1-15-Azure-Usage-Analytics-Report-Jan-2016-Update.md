title: Azure Usage Analytics Report - January 2016 Update
---

I made two updates for the January 2016 edition of the report:

1. Pull 2016 data from the Billing API
2. Added the Usage Table spreadsheet to make it easy to view usage data by day, month, quarter and year in a PivotTable.

You can download the latest report here - [Azure Usage Analytics Report Jan 2016 Update](/files/Azure%20Usage%20Analytics%20(API)%20Jan%202016.xlsx).

Cheers!
